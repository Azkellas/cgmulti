# CG multi

Github repository of [CG multi](http://cgmulti.azke.fr)

It helps you visualizing and comparing any player multi ranks.
The site is a first try to dive into web-related technologies and languages. As such, it is without doubt full of awful issues that I know of and bad habits that I don't.
Feel free to review, comment or improve the code.


## How to add a new multi
Add its url-name in **update_leaderboards.py** line **30** and in **parse.js** line **5** (not optimal, should be stored only once in the future)
